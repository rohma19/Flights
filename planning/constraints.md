### Constraints

#### External
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Adherence to aviation regulations and guidelines set by aviation authorities and governing bodies.
- **API Limitations:** Dependency on third-party APIs for flight data, which may have usage limitations, rate limits, or pricing constraints.
- **Data Privacy:** Compliance with data protection laws and regulations such as GDPR, ensuring the security and privacy of users' personal information.
- **Network Connectivity:** Dependence on internet connectivity for real-time flight updates, which can be unreliable in certain regions or during travel.
- **Platform Compatibility:** Ensuring compatibility with various operating systems (iOS, Android) and devices (smartphones, tablets) to reach a broader user base.

#### Internal (Involuntary)
- **Budget Limitations:** Resource constraints such as budget limitations for development, marketing, and maintenance of the app.
- **Time Constraints:** Limited timeframe for development, testing, and deployment due to project deadlines or market demands.
- **Technical Expertise:** Availability of skilled developers and technical resources for implementing complex features and maintaining the app.

#### Internal (Voluntary)
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly defining the scope of the app to prioritize essential features and functionalities within the available resources.
- **User Experience Focus:** Commitment to delivering an intuitive and user-friendly interface, which may require additional time and effort during design and development.
- **Quality Assurance:** Dedication to thorough testing and quality assurance processes to ensure a bug-free and reliable user experience, potentially extending the development timeline.
- **Sustainability:** Consideration of long-term sustainability and scalability of the app, including future updates, maintenance, and scalability to accommodate increasing user demands.

These constraints provide a framework for understanding the limitations and boundaries within which the flight widget app must operate, both from external factors and internal project considerations.
